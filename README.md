-Ther is the 'About' page that shows all the info about the Gym.
-Ther is the 'Contact us' page that makes the customers contact the managers of the Gym, and send them a message that saved in the database so the managers of the gym can read it later and respond with it.
-Ther are 'Trakes' in the Gym (under development) like:

2- Fitness
3- Fighting games
-Ther are 'Login' and 'Register' pages for the customers and their data are saved in the database
